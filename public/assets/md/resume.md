## Profile

I am a developer with a passion to learn and contribute. I have recent experience coding React websites, React Native phone applications, and backend services needed to supply and compute data. I seek out best practices and standards in technology. I enjoy collaborating with teammates and clients alike to build complete solutions. Looking forward, I strive to continue learning in an ever-changing field of software engineering, building intuitive applications, and collaborating with passionate and friendly people. For fun, I often play fútbol, dabble in photography, and hike.
